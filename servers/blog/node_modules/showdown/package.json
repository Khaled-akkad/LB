Rather, I found it\r\nsome time back at <http://attacklab.net/showdown/> and wanted to see it\r\navailable on GitHub.\r\n\r\nAll credit and praise for authoring this library should go to John Fraser.\r\n\r\nOh, and John Gruber of course.\r\n\r\nThat said, I have recently see some GitHub forking activity and a pull\r\nrequest. As such, I will endeavor to ordain myself as a maintainer of\r\nShowdown, at least as it exists on GitHub.\r\n\r\nApologies for any confusion or perceived misinformation.\r\n\r\nCheers,  \r\nCorey\r\n\r\n\r\nShowdown -- A JavaScript port of Markdown\r\n=========================================\r\n\r\nShowdown Copyright (c) 2007 John Fraser.\r\n<http://www.attacklab.net/>\r\n\r\nOriginal Markdown Copyright (c) 2004-2005 John Gruber\r\n<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>\r\n\r\nRedistributable under a BSD-style open source license.\r\nSee license.txt for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's it for?\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nDevelopers can use Showdown to:\r\n\r\n * Add in-browser preview to existing Markdown apps\r\n\r\n    Showdown's output is (almost always) identical to\r\n    markdown.pl's, so the server can reproduce exactly\r\n    the output that the user saw.  (See below for\r\n    exceptions.)\r\n\r\n * Add Markdown input to programs that don't support it\r\n\r\n    Any app that accepts HTML input can now be made to speak\r\n    Markdown by modifying the input pages's HTML.  If your\r\n    application lets users edit documents again later,\r\n    then they won't have access to the original Markdown\r\n    text.  But this should be good enough for many\r\n    uses -- and you can do it with just a two-line\r\n    `onsubmit` function!\r\n\r\n * Add Markdown input to closed-source web apps\r\n\r\n    You can write bookmarklets or userscripts to extend\r\n    any standard textarea on the web so that it accepts\r\n    Markdown instead of HTML.  With a little more hacking,\r\n    the same can probably be done with  many rich edit\r\n    controls.\r\n\r\n * Build new web apps from scratch\r\n\r\n    A Showdown front-end can send back text in Markdown,\r\n    HTML or both, so you can trade bandwidth for server\r\n    load to reduce your cost of operation.  If your app\r\n    requires JavaScript, you won't need to do any\r\n    Markdown processing on the server at all.  (For most\r\n    uses, you'll still need to sanitize the HTML before\r\n    showing it to other users -- but you'd need to do\r\n    that anyway if you're allowing raw HTML in your\r\n    Markdown.)\r\n\r\n\r\nBrowser Compatibility\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nShowdown has been tested successfully with:\r\n\r\n - Firefox 1.5 and 2.0\r\n - Internet Explorer 6 and 7\r\n - Safari 2.0.4\r\n - Opera 8.54 and 9.10\r\n - Netscape 8.1.2\r\n - Konqueror 3.5.4\r\n\r\nIn theory, Showdown will work in any browser that supports ECMA 262 3rd Edition (JavaScript 1.5).  The converter itself might even work in things that aren't web browsers, like Acrobat.  No promises.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown Differences in Output\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nIn most cases, Showdown's output is identical to that of Perl Markdown v1.0.2b7.  What follows is a list of all known deviations.  Please email me if you find more.\r\n\r\n\r\n *  This release uses the HTML parser from Markdown 1.0.2b2,\r\n    which means it fails `Inline HTML (Advanced).text` from\r\n    the Markdown test suite:\r\n\r\n        <div>\r\n        <div>\r\n        unindented == broken\r\n        </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n\r\n *  Showdown doesn't support the markdown=\"1\" attribute:\r\n\r\n        <div markdown=\"1\">\r\n             Markdown does *not* work in here.\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    This is half laziness on my part and half stubbornness.\r\n    Markdown is smart enough to process the contents of span-\r\n    level tags without screwing things up; shouldn't it be\r\n    able to do the same inside block elements?  Let's find a\r\n    way to make markdown=\"1\" the default.\r\n\r\n\r\n *  You can only nest square brackets in link titles to a\r\n    depth of two levels:\r\n\r\n        [[fine]](http://www.attacklab.net/)\r\n        [[[broken]]](http://www.attacklab.net/)\r\n\r\n    If you need more, you can escape them with backslashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n *  When sublists have paragraphs, Showdown produces equivalent\r\n    HTML with a slightly different arrangement of newlines:\r\n\r\n        + item\r\n\r\n             - subitem\r\n\r\n               The HTML has a superfluous newline before this\r\n               paragraph.\r\n\r\n             - subitem\r\n\r\n               The HTML here is unchanged.\r\n\r\n             - subitem\r\n\r\n               The HTML is missing a newline after this\r\n               list subitem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n *  Markdown.pl creates empty title attributes for\r\n    inline-style images:\r\n\r\n        Here's an empty title on an inline-style\r\n        ![image](http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10).\r\n\r\n    I tried to replicate this to clean up my diffs during\r\n    testing, but I went too far: now Showdown also makes\r\n    empty titles for reference-style images:\r\n\r\n        Showdown  makes an empty title for\r\n        reference-style ![images][] too.\r\n\r\n        [images]: http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10\r\n\r\n\r\n *  With crazy input, Markdown will mistakenly put\r\n    `<strong>` or `<em>` tags in URLs:\r\n\r\n        <a href=\"<*Markdown adds em tags in here*>\">\r\n           improbable URL\r\n        </a>\r\n\r\n    Showdown won't.  But still, don't do that.\r\n\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\n  * Origins\r\n    * [John Fraser](http://http://attacklab.net/):  \r\n      Author of Showdown\r\n    * [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/):  \r\n      Author of Markdown\r\n  * Maintenance\r\n    * [Corey Innis](http://github.com/coreyti):  \r\n      GitHub project maintainer\r\n    * [Remy Sharp](http://remysharp.com/):  \r\n      CommonJS-compatibility and more\r\n\r\n",
